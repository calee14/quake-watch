# quake-watch
Earthquakes can cause lots of destruction and harm which makes it one of the worst natural disasters in the world. Quake Watch's goal is to help bring awareness of when the next earthquake could possibly come so people can prepare for it. You might or might not know already but earthquakes can not be predicted. Quake Watch is not designed to be a completely accurate earthquake predicter but it estimates when the next earthquake will happen based on past data. Quake Watch analyzes past earthquakes and finds a pattern then it makes a prediction of when the next earthquake will strike. The analyzing and pattern finding is accomplished through machine learning algorithms.

# Notes:
- Planning to use a different type of model since neural network won't predict.
